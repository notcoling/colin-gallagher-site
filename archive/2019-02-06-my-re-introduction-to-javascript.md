description: I''ve been dabbling in JavaScript since 2013. Since then, a lot has changed. Over the years I've gone from using Angular, to React, to Vue, and everywhere between. There are so many fun use cases for each of these technologies, and as they've matured some have become more obvious front runners. Which for me, means that re-visiting my knowledge and skills becomes essential.

JavaScript is a wonderful language with a rich ecosystem. But compared to Python (my other favorite), it's a bit more ambiguous when it comes to best practices and quirks. Which means that as I mature alongside these frameworks, it's important to make sure I keep my feet firmly planted on the ground when it comes to writing JavaScript. This way I can accurately evaluate new tools and methods, and have more fun creating things.

It's never fun to jump into a JavaScript code base and spend hours dissecting why it's organized a certain way. And as I move deeper into React and Vue, I've had a few moments where I needed to take a step back and ask some basic questions about JavaScript.

So without further ado, I'll list out some of my favorite tutorials for the various JavaScript frameworks, environments and tools I'm using.

These tutorials and references have been a great help with getting me back into the world of JavaScript after some heavy Python usage the last couple years. I'll be posting a Python learning list as well (it's quite a bit longer for some reason...). I hope you can find some enjoyment and use out of this list as well. Cheers!

P.S. This is a living list, with updates as I find more resources I love.
