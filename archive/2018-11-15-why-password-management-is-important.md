We all have more passwords than we can possibly remember. Even if you try to re-use the same password over and over, your bank probably makes you add a special character or a capital letter. And your electric company limits your password to no more than 12 characters.

If you haven’t thought about how secure your passwords are, or how to manage them properly, you probably have a sheet of paper somewhere with 15 variations of your name and birth year written on it.

This is how I used to do things too. But there’s a better way.

# Why Your Passwords, and how you manage Them Matter

Using the same password for your online accounts is dangerous. Leaving you only as secure as a single password. If one account gets compromised, other accounts become compromised as well.

And using passwords that are simple or based on personal information leaves you even more vulnerable because they are easier for hackers to guess, or crack.

We really on our online accounts for more than ever before (banking, bills, social life, healthcare, etc.), so with their growth in importance, there should also be a growth in the care we take to keep them secure.

Keeping your accounts secure starts with creating strong, unique passwords for all your accounts, and knowing where to store those passwords for later.

# What makes a password strong?

Depending on who you ask, the answer to this question might change. There are traditional approaches to password strength, mathematical approaches, and those who recommend making a password memorable, in addition to one of the other two methods.

In reality, all three of these methods can be effective, so I’ll go over each in brief.

## The Traditional Approach

The traditional approach to making better passwords is to make them longer, and use a combination of letters, numbers, and symbols. For example, you would want to include uppercase, and lower case letters, as well as numbers and symbols/special characters (i.e. ! @ % ^) in your password.

In an attempt to make them more memorable it is sometimes recommended that you use a memorable lyric or series of words that are meaningful to you as well. But when including special characters and capitalization, you might have trouble remembering exactly how your word or phrase looked when you created the password.

This on the whole will help you create better passwords, but they won’t be as memorable, and they also won’t be the most secure either.

## The Mathematical Approach

To increase security to the maximum, you can measure your password strength in terms of ‘information entropy’. To pull it straight out of Wikipedia, “Instead of the number of guesses needed to find the password with certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of "entropy bits" in a password.

A password with, say, 42 bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of 42 bits chosen randomly, say by a fair coin toss. Put another way, a password with 42 bits of strength would require 242 (4,398,046,511,104) attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, adding one bit of entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required, which makes an attacker's task twice as difficult. On average, an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.”

This makes it so your password is nearly impossible to guess. But it will almost certainly be just as possible to remember.

## The Memorable Approach

For those who want to have a mathematically secure, but memorable password, there is a happy medium. Specifically the method outlined by Randall Munroe in [XKCD](https://xkcd.com/).

## My Approach

My approach is to just use password generators most of the time. Because I don’t plan on remembering any of them, ever.

I only remember a handful of master passwords, and this has made my life so much easier. With a password manager, I just need to remember a couple of passwords and the rest is done automatically for me via a combination of browser extensions and apps.

# Managing All of Your Passwords

You can’t do it on a piece of paper, or in an excel spreadsheet. You have too many accounts, and those are not secure options.

## Password Managers Are Essential Tools for the 21st Century

If you already use a password manger, skip this section, you already know what’s up. But if you aren’t using a password manager. Pay close attention.

In order to manage having a unique password, that meets the criteria above of a ‘good’ password, you are going to have tens, or hundreds of passwords to remember. Which is just not possible. Maybe it would have been years ago if we still had to communicate our ideals through oratory like they did in ancient Greece, but with our current memory spans, it’s not feasible.

You need a password manager. These are tools that will store your login details (username, password), and allow you to query them the next time you need them to log in. Many modern password managers come with Google Chrome, or Firefox extensions so that you don’t even have to leave your web browser to have your login credentials entered on the website you are visiting.

They are the perfect solution to the problem of needing to have strong passwords, and having them be unique to each account under your control. But which password manager should you use? If you haven’t been using them you might not know where to start. I’ll go over my top three to help give you an idea of what’s out there. I also created [strongpassword.ninja](https://strongpassword.ninja/) to help make choosing a password manager easier.

# The Top 3 Password Managers

## Dashlane

Dashlane is by far my favorite password manager. The apps, website, and autfill all feel very smooth and well crafted. And dashlane has a bevy of other services that are included in a premium subscription, like a security dashboard, VPN, monitoring, and sync. It's a great product, and the best premium password manager by far.

## Bitwarden

Bitwarden is comparable to other leaders in the password manager space, but it's also open source! The chrome extension works great (and works in [Brave browser](https://brave.com/) as well!), and the password management features feel almost on par with the market leaders in this space, like Dashlane, 1Password, or Lastpass. If you don't want to pay for a password manager, this is your best choice.

## Lastpass

Lastpass feels a bit dated to me in terms of its features and usability. Not to mention that their trial process was a bit unclear while I went through it. But it would be a great place to start if you're looking for an industry leading password manager with a low sticker price, and a free trial.

# Other Security Measures

Beyond just having a strong and unique password there are also other things to keep in mind to help keep your accounts secure.

## Two Factor Authentication

If a website offers two-factor authentication, use it. There are a variety of good apps out there, like Google Authenticator that make this process easy. Adding this extra layer of security is worth it. And with a password manager, this will make your accounts even more secure.

## SSL/HTTPS

Always be sure that if you are going to purchase something online, that the website you are using is being accessed via HTTPS, and not just HTTP. And of course, think about whether or not you really trust the website with your payment information in the first place.

I hope some of that information was useful, and I hope this inspired you to take a look at password managers if you had not already.
