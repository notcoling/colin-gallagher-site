  so far. Notion is a cross between a project management tool and a wiki. It allows you to create documents, wiki's and to-do lists in a way that does not confine you to a particular workflow. Notion's platform is extremely flexible and free form, which is something that sets it apart and makes it great for a variety of different projects and purposes.

Notion is easy to learn, but it's also extremely powerful once you discover everything that's possible in the platform. And I've really only just gotten started.

I'm using Notion because it looks and feels great. And because I've not been fully satisfied with my workflow and productivity in other tools. Notion looked like a new and fresh perspective on project management, and what better way to start of 2019, but with a brand new tool, and some new workflows?

I'm using Notion for a little bit of everything right now.

## A Personal Wiki

Notion is a great tool for keeping track of things like your goals, notes, ideas, and other things that don't really have a place in other project management tools or apps. It's one thing to keep notes in a document, or something like Google Keep, but having a Wiki-like platform to keep track of your life makes it very easy and natural to start documenting the things that normally might fall through the cracks.

For me, it's been a huge time saver being able to save and organize notes and ideas in one place. No more hunting down documents on my desktop. And no more worrying about sync between devices. With Notion, it's easy just to type out a note or an idea and save it to the cloud, done.

## Project Management

For project management, Notion offers most of the features found in other applications like to-do lists and even Kanban. I'm a huge fan of Trello (and I'm still keeping my subscription to manage development projects), and Notion does a great job of offering project management that feel on par with the competition, but inside of an application that doesn't force you only to do project management.

Where Notion stumbles here is in the productivity department. Without an API, and the capability to automate your 'boards' or pages, Trello still wins in this category, at least for me.

## Documents and Writing

I've also started to use Notion's more document oriented features to do some note taking, and even do things like writing this blog post. Notion looks and feels great when writing, but for serious projects, it's still not a replacement for a traditional WYSIWYG editor or word processing applications like Word or Google Docs.

Notion has been incredible so far. My only complaints have been the performance of the mobile application which tends to be fairly slow, and the idea of keeping my goals, aspirations, and to-do lists entirely in the cloud with a new tool. Otherwise, it looks like I'm all in with Notion. Here's hoping Notion is here to stay.
