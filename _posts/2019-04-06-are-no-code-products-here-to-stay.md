  Some might say that we are finally entering the “no code” era, or the era of
  “codeless development”. If you take a look at some of the products coming out
  as of late, you might get that impression as well.

There are an abundance of easy to use tools available that allow people with little to no programming ability to create things that only a few years ago would have been unimaginable without knowing your way around the command line and knowing a programming language. Drag and drop no code tools exist for various domain spaces, and they have started taking over. Whether its building websites, analyzing data or automating daily tasks, there are a plethora of awesome tools available to make these things easy to do without having to know how to write a single line of Python, JavaScript, or C.

[Webflow](https://webflow.com/) and [Squarespace](https://www.squarespace.com/) allow you to create beautifully designed and responsive websites, without diving into HTML, CSS, or Javascript. [Bubble](https://bubble.is/) and [Coda](https://coda.io/welcome) allow you to create complex web applications via a handy drag and drop interface, without needing a web application framework like Python-based Django, or Ruby on Rails. And tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) let you automate almost anything without ever needing to look under the hood and work with an API for the service you want to automate a task for.

All of this makes us more productive. And it can be a lot of fun. [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) and [Coda](https://coda.io/welcome) just finished up a [Maker Festival](https://www.producthunt.com/makers-festival-2019/voting) around no code products. And those who participated made a lot of cool stuff! Stuff like a [Seasonal recipe chooser](https://coda.io/d/Seasonal-Recipes-Chooser_dyZ17RBWmf9/Questions_suyAd?viewMode=play#_luWfc), and [a site to help you learn guitar](https://coda.io/d/GUITAR-MASTER_dNitEkba-ki/Welcome_surjK#_luEWY).

## But are these solutions really a replacement for code?

After all, when it comes to designing complex solutions in no code platforms, the problem-solving skills learned through programming make things much easier. Bubble still requires some basic understanding of web application logic, [Webflow](https://webflow.com/) lets you make changes to your sites CSS, and [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) lets you play around with [webhooks](https://zapier.com/blog/what-are-webhooks/) to connect to more complex services. All of these services make it easy to get started without code. But if you don’t understand code some of the more complex functionality is still inaccessible. And as these services and the services we’ve come to rely on for our daily work become more complex, I’m not sure no code will ever fully catch up.

Sometimes no code solutions also encourage people to try and solve problems better solved via programming with clunky tools not quite right for the job. I’m not convinced that a [Coda app](https://coda.io/welcome) is better for documentation than a [simple static site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page), and using [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) means that you’ll pay a pretty penny over time for something that could have been solved by a developer for a fraction of the cost.

With that in mind, if you know what to expect from these platforms, and just want to avoid complexity, I think many of these solutions are better than their code heavy counterparts. After all, not having to deal with any technical debt or maintaining systems comes with productivity gains. But remaining aware of how your work will scale, or what the full scope of a project might look like can do a lot for saving you a headache in the future. 

I definitely think the “no code”, or “low code” revolution is here, and here to stay. There are some amazing products built without code out there, like [MakerPad for example](https://www.makerpad.co/). But I think it's important to keep in mind [the law of the instrument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument).

"I suppose it is tempting, if the only tool you have is a hammer, to treat everything as if it were a nail."
