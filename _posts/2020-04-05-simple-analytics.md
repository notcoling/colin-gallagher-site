I've moved my web analytics for my blog and personal projects to Simple Analytics.

Iâ€™ve used Google Analytics on my blog and other smaller projects for a very long time. But Iâ€™ve always felt that Google Analytics was overkill for that.

Google Analytics is a great service - but I'm only using around 10% of the features.

- I donâ€™t care about detailed behavior flows
- Or in-depth traffic source analysis
- Iâ€™m not using attribution analysis
- Do I need to be reminded that I have no real-time users at the moment?

And donâ€™t even get me started on [the privacy concerns](https://hackernoon.com/data-privacy-concerns-with-google-b946f2b7afea).

When I looked at the alternatives - there were a lot of choices. But they too often offered too much, or were charging on a per site basis.

[Matomo](https://matomo.org/) is also too functionality much for a small site, [AWStats](https://www.awstats.org/) feels dated, and [Netlify Analytics](https://www.netlify.com/products/analytics/) is too expensive. With many others falling into those categories.

My use case is primarily small projects, content sites, and blogs. I want only a few key statistics, and minimal setup for each site. 

For that, [Simple Analytics](https://simpleanalytics.com/) seems like the best choice.

## Itâ€™s easy to use

Simple Analytics is dead simple to set up.

- Add the scripts
- Visit the pages
- Youâ€™re done

The reports are extremely easy to read and understand. And if you need events, [you can add those too](https://docs.simpleanalytics.com/events).

## It's easy to manage multiple sites

Because I have multiply sites, itâ€™s important for me to be able to shift from one to the next. Google Analytics does this very well, but the setup per site gets to be a littleâ€¦ much.

Simple Analytics makes it really easy to have multiple sites, and to see the reporting across them. The only thing I see missing here is a mobile application. But I probably don't need to be constantly checking stats on my phone.

## I still get the metrics I care about

Like I mentioned above, for small projects there are only a few things I really care about.

* Visits
* Visitors
* Page Views
* Referrers
* Devices
* Locations

Custom events (like a newsletter signup) are going to be important for me on some sites, so Iâ€™ll need to explore that feature in depth with other projects to see if it meets my needs.

Beyond that, there arenâ€™t many stats I find myself tracking on small projects.

## Privacy is important

I believe in user privacy and I appreciate it when other site owners respect my privacy.

Itâ€™s time I did my part to practice what I preach here.

There is no point in subjecting visitors to Googleâ€™s tracking if Iâ€™m not actually using any of the functionality that would justify it.

## I like the project

Last but not least on my list of reasons to switch: the project resonates with me.

Itâ€™s a [small but growing project](https://blog.simpleanalytics.com/how-we-hit-our-30k-annual-recurring-revenue-milestone) and I want to do all I can to support my fellow makers out there.

What better way than to vote with my wallet, put my money where my mouth is, etc. and offer support by becoming a customer when it makes sense?
