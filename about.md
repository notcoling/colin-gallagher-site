### What I Do Outside of Work

When I’m not working I like to work on side projects, read, and explore Oregon. I try to learn and meet new people as much as possible. 

### What I'm Working On

I’ve always got a project or two that I’m actively working on. If you’re curious you can head over to my projects page too take a look. Most of the things I’m working on revolve around web technologies but occasionally I work on things like games, VR, or even music.

### How to Talk to Me
