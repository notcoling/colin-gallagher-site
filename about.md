### What I Do Outside of Work

When I’m not working I like to work on side projects, read, write, and explore Oregon.

### What I'm Working On

I’ve always got a project or two that I’m actively working on. If you’re curious you can head over to my projects page too take a look. I make a lot of things with web technologies but occasionally I work on things like games, VR, or even music.
