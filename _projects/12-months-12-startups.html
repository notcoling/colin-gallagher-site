<p>I love building things. But I struggle with finishing things.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m committing to building and shipping a new product every month for a year. Beginning in May 2020.</p>

<p>The concept of a startup every month for a year is not new. I’ve followed <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">Pieter Levels</a> and <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html">Jon Yongfook</a> on their journeys and their successes doing 12 startups in 12 months, and I think this could work for me too.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why I’m going to embark on this journey.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-things">✅ Finishing Things</h3>
<p>I have no shortage of ideas to work on. But when it comes to finishing I often leave projects in construction. I’m a creative person, and as Pieter Levels said, we like to work on ‘new’ things instead of finishing ‘old’ things. This project will force me to stick to a deadline and finish projects.</p>

<h3 id="shipping-things">🚢 Shipping Things</h3>
<p>When I do finish projects I struggle with launching them. It might be a component of finishing things (see above), fear of failure, or something else. Whatever it is this project will help me get over that hurdle and ship things.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-the-probability-of-success">📈 Increasing the Probability of Success</h3>
<p>Some ideas suck. Some don’t. By increasing the number of projects I launch, I’ll have a more varied portfolio of projects. Which means that my odds of finishing a project that makes money, gains users, or scratches an itch increases drastically.</p>

<h3 id="chaning-my-habits">🏃 Changing my Habits</h3>
<p>This project will force me to complete things, and show them to the world. Which is not something I typically like to do. I’d like to change that.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I’ll be looking at ideas I’ve been sitting on and things I’ve been wanting to work on and building a roadmap of projects that I could feasibly bring to market in under a month.</p>

<h2 id="updates-on-my-progress">Updates on my Progress</h2>
<p>I’ll be posting updates here every month as new projects are posted. I’ll also be posting updates on <a href="https://colingallagher.me/">my blog</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/notcolinn">Twitter</a> as work progresses.</p>
