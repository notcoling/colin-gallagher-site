<p>I love building things. But I struggle with finishing things.</p>

<p>That’s why I’m committing to building and shipping a new product every month for a year.</p>

<p>The concept of a startup every month for a year is not new. I’ve followed <a href="https://levels.io/12-startups-12-months/">Pieter Levels</a> and <a href="https://blog.yongfook.com/12-startups-in-12-months.html">Jon Yongfook</a> on their journeys and their successes doing 12 startups in 12 months, and I think this could work for me too.</p>

<p>Here are a few reasons why I’m going to embark on this journey.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-things">Finishing Things</h3>
<p>I have no shortage of ideas to work on. But when it comes to finishing I often leave projects in construction. I’m a creative person, and as Pieter Levels said, we have this problem in common, and we like to work on ‘new’ things instead of finishing ‘old’ things. This project will force me to stick to a deadline and finish projects.</p>

<h3 id="shipping-things">Shipping Things</h3>
<p>When I do finish projects I struggle with launching them. It might be a component of finishing things (see above), fear of failure, or something else. Whatever it is this project will help me get over that hurdle and ship things.</p>

<h3 id="increasing-the-probability-of-success">Increasing the Probability of Success</h3>
<p>Some ideas suck. Some don’t. By increasing the number of projects I launch, I’ll have a more varied portfolio of projects. Which means that my odds of finishing a project that makes money, gains users, or scratches an itch increases drastically.</p>

<h3 id="chaning-my-habits">Changing my Habits</h3>
<p>This project will force me to complete things, and show them to the world. Which is not something I typically like to do. I’d like to change that.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
<p>I’ll be looking at ideas I’ve been sitting on and things I’ve been wanting to work on and building a roadmap of projects that I could feasibly bring to market in under a month.</p>

<h2 id="updates-on-my-progress">Updates on my Progress</h2>
<p>I’ll be posting updates every month as new projects are posted. I’ll also be posting updates on my blog and Twitter as work progresses.</p>
